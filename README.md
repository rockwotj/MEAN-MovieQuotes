# Moviequotes on a MEAN Stack
This is an example of the Moviequotes webapp implemented in a MEAN stack.

### What is MEAN?
MEAN is an acronym for the technologies used to build this:

Mongo DB <br>
Express.js <br>
AngularJs <br>
NodeJS

### Structure
There is a simple Angular app served statically from a NodeJs server. The Node server also acts as a simple JSON REST API (Yay for acronyms!).

Angular then communicates to the DB using that API. Voila! A simple CRUD app for your favorite moviequotes. 

### But why?
I learn by doing. This was my chance to learn Node, express and MongoDB. I already knew Angular, so it was a way to wrap my mind around the MEAN way to web development. I find the stack to be very easy to work with, and being able to write client-side and server-side code in the same way is really nice.
